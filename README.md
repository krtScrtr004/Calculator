# CALCULATOR USING STD::STACK

A calculator that utilizes **std::stack** to evaluate simple mathematical expressions. This implementation handles basic operations like _addition_ (+), _subtraction_ (-), _multiplication_ (*), _division_ (/), and _parentheses_ (()). It operates by first converting the user's raw (_infix_) expression into a _postfix_ form, and then uses std::stack to compute the result.
